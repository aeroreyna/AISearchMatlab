# General Framework

Population based metaheuristics can be implemented using a general framework, independently of the natural phenomenon inspiration.
This allows their study to be focus on the mechanisms that modify the solutions in the population through the iterative process.

Usually, the first step involves the definition of a set of $M$ randomly initialized solutions as follows:

$$
x_i \in X \mid i = 1, 2, \ldots, M
$${#eq:population}

such that:

$$
x_i = [x_{i,1}, x_{i,2}, \ldots, x_{i,D}] \; | \; x_{i,d} = R(B^{low}_d, B^{high}_d)
$${#eq:solution_x}

where $D$ is the dimensionality of the problem (number of decision variables or parameters), $x_i$ is the $i$ solution of the population $X$ and $x_{i,d} = R(B^{low}_d, B^{high}_d)$ is the uniform random assignation bounded by the target solution space (search space) for the dimension $d$.
The solutions $x_i$ (or individuals) represent candidate solutions to be tested on the optimization problem.
These are assigned to a corresponding quality value (or fitness) related to the objective function $f( \cdot )$ that describes the optimization problem, such that:

$$
f_i \in F \mid f_{i} = f\left( x_{i} \right),\; i=1,2,\ldots,M
$${#eq:general_FF}

Using the population $X_{M\times D}$ and fitness $F_{M\times 1}$ information, new candidate solutions are generated by modifying currently available solutions.
This is achieved by applying the algorithm operators (usually designed by drawing inspiration from an observed natural phenomenon).
For most cases, this process may be illustrated by the following expression:

$$
x_{i}^{'} = x_{i} + \mathrm{\Delta}x_{i}
$${#eq:change_operator}

where $x_{i}^{'}$ denotes the candidate solution generated by adding up a specified update vector $\mathrm{\Delta} x_{i}$ to $x_{i}$.
This update vector $\mathrm{\Delta}x_{i}$ depend on the specific algorithm operators.
The generated solutions are evaluated in the fitness function to obtain their corresponding score, such as $F' = f(X')$.

Finally, most nature-inspired algorithms include some kind of selection process, in which the newly generated solutions are compared against those in the current population $X^{k}$ (with $k$ denoting the current iteration) in terms of solution quality, typically with the purpose of choosing the best individual(s) among them.
As a result of this process, a new set of solutions $X^{k + 1}\mathbf{= \{}x_{1}^{k + 1}\mathbf{,}x_{2}^{k + 1}\mathbf{,\ldots,}x_{M}^{k + 1}\mathbf{\}}$, corresponding to the following iteration (or generation) '$k + 1$', is generated.

This whole process is iteratively repeated until a particular stop criterion is met (i.e., a maximum number of iterations is reached).
Once this happens, the best solution found by the algorithm $x^{*}$ is reported as the best approximation for the global optimum. The best solution is the one encounter in whole optimization process with the maximum fitness value, can be expressed as follows:

$$
f(x^{*}) \geq f(x_i^k) \; \forall i, k
$${#eq:best_sol}
