# AISearchMatlab
AISearch Library for Matlab

This is a open source toolbox to **implement**, **test**, **learn** and **compare** metaheuristic algorithms. 

The main idea of this toolbox is to accelerate the learning curve for this algorithms, by offering a clean and reusable code. We would like that this toolbox is accesible to new applications even for people with low or none knowlage of this techniques.

The things to do are:

- [ ] Download this git. [Link](https://github.com/aeroreyna/AISearchMatlab/archive/master.zip)
- [ ] Unzip the folder.
- [ ] Add the folder and subfolder to the MatLab Path.
- [ ] Execute one of the examples.

The examples provided are easily configurable to use the algorithm of your choise. So far this is the list of metaheuristic algorithms to implement:

- [X] Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- [X] Differential Evolution (DE)
- [X] Harmony Search (HS)
- [X] Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
- [X] Cuckoo Search (CS)
- [X] States of Matter Search (SMS)
- [X] Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)
- [ ] Bat Algorithm (BA)
- [ ] Simulated Annealing (SA)
- [ ] Firefly Algorithm (FA)
- [ ] Social Spider Optimization (SSO)
